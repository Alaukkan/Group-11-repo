## Project Description

Aim of this project is to design and produce a desktop mounted robot pet resembling a penguin.
This robot pet, or RoboPet(™, Ⓒ, Patent Pending) if you will, will be stationary, but able to pivot in place and move its arms (wings?).
It is capable of simulating simple functions of a pet such as demanding particular food items and communicating using sound and LEDs.
Mechanical and structural parts needed for the project will be designed and 3D-printed by us.

## Contents of the Repository

In this repository you will find everything needed to copy and manufacture our project, including:

* Source code in main.py file.
